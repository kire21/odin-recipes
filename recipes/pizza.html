    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza originated in Naples and started off as poor man's street food in
      the 18th & 19th centuries as a plain flat bread gradually acquiring
      toppings such as tomatoes. In 1889, a famous Neapolitan pizza-maker,
      Raffaele Esposito, made a pizza for Queen Margherita using ingredients to
      match the colours of the Italian flag - tomato, basil and mozzarella. The
      pizza was a hit with the Queen and over time has become a hit all over the
      world! When you visit Naples be sure to visit the oldest pizzeria,
      Sorbillo, for the best Margherita and others. Of course, you can always
      make your own and this is my homemade version - I have given you the
      classic Margherita topping and also one with prosciutto and rocket. But of
      course you can experiment with whatever toppings you like. If you can't
      get fresh yeast, then you can make the dough with the dried variety, but
      check instructions on the packet.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500g strong flour</li>
      <li>5g salt</li>
      <li>10g fresh yeast</li>
      <li>325ml lukewarm water</li>
      <li>150g tinned chopped tomatoes or tomato passata</li>
      <li>Salt & pepper</li>
      <li>1 x tablespoons extra virgin olive oil & extra for drizzling</li>
      <li>1 x tablespoon grated parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 x ball mozzarella</li>
      <li>A few fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>Extra virgin oil for drizzling</li>
      <li>1 x ball mozzarella</li>
      <li>1 x tablespoon grated parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First make the dough. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water. Combine
        flour and salt in a large bowl. Gradually add the yeast mixture, mixing
        well until you obtain a dough. Place dough on a lightly floured work
        surface and knead for about 10 minutes. Cover with a cloth or cling film
        and leave to rest in a warm place for at least 30 minutes until the
        dough has doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees centigrade.</li>
      <li>
        Take the dough, knock it back, then divide into two pieces, cover each
        with a cloth and leave to rest in a warm place for a further 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile prepare the toppings. For the Margherita, place tomatoes or
        passata in a small bowl, season with salt & pepper and stir in 1
        tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Roughly chop the mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle some flour onto a clean work surface and with your fingers
        spread each piece of dough into a roughly round shape with a border,
        make the dough as thin as you can but be careful not to tear it.
        Sprinkle some semolina or flour onto 2 large flat baking trays and place
        the pizza bases on them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over each base. On one, spread
        the tomato evenly over, sprinkle with parmesan, scatter a few basil
        leaves over and top with mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>On the other base, arrange mozzarella and parmesan all over.</li>
      <li>Place both pizzas into the hot oven and bake for 8 - 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the pizzas from the oven, top the Parma ham pizza with rocket and
        serve immediately.
      </li>
